# tail2kafka 

## Overview
tail2kafka is a linux tool for sending log lines into a kafka topic.

It supports local and remote kafka servers, log rotation and batching messages to kafka.

Based off of harelba's tail2kafka and adapted to Kafka 0.8 by mmlac using kafka-python by mumrah


## Known Bugs
Still throws an error on KeyboardInterrupt. Feel free to patch it, it should however not impact
the operation of the tool.

## Contact
Any feedback/suggestions/complaints regarding this tool would be much appreciated. Contributions are most welcome as well, of course.
